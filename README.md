# PyBer_Analysis
Ride share analysis focusing on data visualization
## Challenge
   The purpose for this analysis is to gain a better understanding of of PyBer's ride data in regards to the different types of cities. With this analysis, we hope to better allocate resources, and optimize PyBer's business strategy to better serve customers and increase profits. In order to create the City Type Summary dataframe, we grouped together all of the rides by the type of city they took place in and then added up the total rides, total number of drivers, and total amount of fares collecte. We then divided the total amount of fares collected by the total number of rides for each city type to get the average fare per ride data. Finally, we divided the total amount of fares collected by the total number of drivers for each city type to get the average fare per driver. In order to create the Total Fare by City Type graph, we created a pivot table dataframe with the index being the datetime of each ride and the columns being the three different city types. We then plotted all three of the city type's data onto one graph to compare the fares collected from each city type over time. 
Here is the city type summary

We can see that Urban rides by far contribute the most to the total number of rides and the total fares collected by PyBer. However, since there are less drivers in the rural cities, the rural drivers average more fare per ride. 
The Total Fare by City Type graph can be seen below

Again you can see here that Urban rides contribute over four times the amount of fares compared to rural cities and about two times more than surburban cities. 

While performing this analysis, we ran into several issues that impeded our progress. One of the first road blocks came when attempting to format the data inside of the city type summary dataframe. It was tricky and frustrating trying formatting code after formatting code and looking back at older examples to try to replicate the results. In the end it ended up being almost a fluke getting it right. The second road block came when attempting to plot the total fare by city type graph. It was a challenge figuring out how to get the legend to display the city type that the different line colors corresponded to. We ended up deciding to switch to the MATLAB plotting method as we couldn't figure out the object oriented method. 

Suggestions to the CEO depend on what the company values more. If they are worried about customer satisfaction, we suggest moving more drivers to urban areas where the most rides take place. This would reduce customer wait times in the area where the most customers are ordering rides. If the company is worried about driver satisfaction, we would suggest moving adding more drivers to suburban and rural areas. This would help to even out the average fare per driver metric, so drivers would in general take home more money. To gain further insight into the data, we could analyse the time of day that is most popular for rides. This would allow PyBer to encourage drivers to start driving during popular times. In order to do this, we would organize the merged data frame by the datetime of each ride. Then create bins that group the rides by the time of day of the ride. Then we would create a line graph that plots time of day on the x axis and total rides or total fares on the y axis. Another thing you could look at is specifically which cities tend to bring in the most fares. It could be beneficial to add more drivers to the high performing cities. To do this, we would group the rides by the city that they occured in. Then we would calculate the average fare for each city to find the top producing cities.
